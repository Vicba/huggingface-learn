        "\n",
        "After training a computer vision model, the next step is deployment, but this can lead to challenges like large model sizes, slow prediction times, and limited device memory, especially when deploying on less powerful hardware than used for training. Model optimization is essential to enhance the model's efficiency for these lower-spec devices. This process involves modifying the trained model to ensure it can operate effectively on edge devices, such as microcomputers, mobile devices, and IoT systems, which typically have different and smaller specifications than the high-performance GPUs used during training.\n",

        "- **Resource limitations:** Computer vision models often require high computational resources such as memory, CPU, and GPU. This will be a problem if we want to deploy the model on devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones, embedded systems, or edge devices. Optimization techniques can reduce model size and computational cost and make it deployable for that platform.\n",
        "- **Latency requirements:** Many computer vision applications, such as self-driving cars and augmented reality, require real-time response. This means the model must be able to process data and generate results quickly. Optimization can significantly increase the inference speed of a model and ensure it can meet latency constraints.\n",
        "- **Power consumption:** Devices that use batteries, such as drones and wearable devices, require models with efficient power usage. Optimization techniques can also reduce battery consumption which is often caused by model sizes that are too large.\n",
        "- **Hardware compatibility:** Sometimes, different hardware has its capabilities and limitations. Several optimization techniques are specifically used for specific hardware. If this is done, we can easily overcome the hardware limitations."
